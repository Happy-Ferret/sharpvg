# SharpVG

Sharp Vector Graphics

A library and command line utility to convert bitmaps to SVGs.

Why?

- SVG is currently the only reliable way to scale up pixelated graphics with preserving sharpness of the pixels that works across browsers.
- Converting to SVG might be useful in other scenarios, for example when we want to manipulate the image in real time.

Features!

- converts bitmaps to SVGs
- currently supports only one-colour GIFs as input (originally created for my own use)
- fancy edge-tracing algorithm to maximally optimise output size

Planned features:

- colour support (both indexed and 24-bit)
- PNG input
- animated gif support
